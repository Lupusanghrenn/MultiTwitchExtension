# MultiTwitchExtension
This is the github of the multi twitch extension for chrome. 
This extension allow you to follow your favorites streamers easely.

Actually, you will be up to set up your own feed of streamers who can be configurate in the option part.
The extension itself shows for every onlive steamers they logo, name (display_name == official name), the game they are playing and also the title of the current stream.
You can choose wether or not the extension show the online streamers (their name == url or they display_name)

In the future, you will also be able to :
  - Easely made a multitwitch with your favorite streamers using the extension.
  - Add streamers to your feed with a button when you are currently on the twitch (using the url of the current tab)
  - Receive a chrome notification each time a streamer goes live
    - setup specific channel to use chrome notification
    - disable chrome notification
    - setup the update time between checking witch streamers is currently online
    - send chrome notification only when your navigating on your browser (not when you launch it)
    - personify the text of the chrome extension
    

And even more ...

I will also try to develop this extension for firefox if I'm asked for
